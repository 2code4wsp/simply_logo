# simply_logo

## Description
As a developer I want to make a simple application to create a logo when a graphic designer is an unnecessary overhead cost. This application will automatically generate a simple shape with colors of your choice to apply up to 3 letters and create a logo that can be associated with your business or projects. 

## Installation
When using this application you will need node.js version 16x or above as well as npm installed in your terminal in order to answer the prompts and generate the logo. Keep in mind that after you install npm you should run npm start. Then run node index.js in the terminal to answer the prompts and generate the logo.
